# Unified Memory for kmeans

## Building

You build the project by running `make` either here, or in `/cuda/kmeans`.

You can generated the test data by running `make` in `/data/kmeans/inpuGen`, and then running `./gen_dataset.sh` in that folder. This will generate a host of test files, which can take a few minutes to finish.

## Running

You can run the "best", i.e. most optimized, version of our kmeans solution, by running `./run` in `/cuda/kmeans`, after having built the project, and generated the test data.
